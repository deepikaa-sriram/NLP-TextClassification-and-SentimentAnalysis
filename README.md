# NLP-TextClassification-and-SentimentAnalysis
Rating Movie Reviews: Text Classification &amp; Sentiment Analysis Project
For this project I utilized the Cornell University Movie Review polarity dataset v2.0 obtained from http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/

In this exercise I developed a classification model to predict the Positive/Negative labels based on text content alone. Then, I utilized Sentiment Analysis utilizing VADER to determine whether the accuracy of the model improves.
